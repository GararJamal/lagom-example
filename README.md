[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jvz/lagom-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jvz/lagom-example)

This repository contains the source code for an example blog microservice
using the Lagom framework. Also included are code examples from the sample
project generated by the Lagom Maven archetype.

Look inside `blog-api` for the microservice API, and `blog-impl` contains the
implementation code.

This repository is explained in my [blog post about Lagom][lagom].

To run, execute:

    mvn lagom:runAll

The REST APIs from all microservices are aggregated onto port 9000. Port 8000
contains the service locator REST API from Lagom.
